IMAGINE IF LEBRON HAD A HEALTHY ANTHONY DAVIS WHEN HE WENT BACK TO CLEVELAND
That was beautiful. Im offended by this song tho.
7:46, stats on shots could potentially be mega millions numbers. Haha





05/16/2023, 7:59am
8:02  ..... Ooops 🤦🏿‍♂️
That start with Vanderbilt's block is so glorious.
your analysis' are pretty hard to take seriously now that you've outed yourself as a massively biased warrior fan
Freakin biased narrator ,
Poole is trash this series,
yup this dude hate lakers.
Like I said Even before the playoff the DPOY goes to AD.
First rule in NBA refs book:when in doubt always favor LeBron's team. God I can't wait for him to retire so we can enjoy NBA again. Him and Harden.
Where's Draydumb ? Where he at ? Podcasting ?  Where Dat man with the Big Mouth. ? Punching the Lil guys?  He is a Clown show disappearing act.
Question something I noticed even back during the grizz series. How long are the ref letting AD camp in the paint on defense? It's even more evident in this series due the warriors high volume of perimeter oriented screens and hand offs. There's times when LBJ is doing it also but not as much as AD or at least lebron does a better job of at making it look like hes guarding a zone with a opponent in it.
Those shorties mopped the floor with those bigs!
Will there be a video detailing the moving screens? It’s gotten pretty out of hand
The Warriors are such a boring team man.
youre allowed to be biased, but it is kind of annoying because you skew the perspective of the game- how it was called, if refs missed more stuff for one team (you implied lakers got away with a lot, ie the mention of lebron's travel but not Curry's at 8:51, and some foul calls). With that being said, good video.
Edit: your bias is actually quite strong. At end it was a clear and obvious foul by Klay, since when can you bear hug someone from behind? when has that ever been a legal guarding position?
Where is your analysis of game 2?
Game 2 please hahahah. And compare their throw numbers
This video and take didn't age well😬
coach, do a video on game 2 about how the warriors adjusted their attack and ran over the lakers team. The whole 4th was just garbage time
They must've shrunk overnight cus: Game II?
FTAs: Lakers 29.....Warriors 6.
You know Coach Kerr is watching your videos. I already see him reducing minutes for Poole and Divencenzo these playoffs and I knew immediately he probably got it from you Coach 😂
Can we get a Game 2 breakdown ? God bless you coach
I watched this again after game 2 to check if the Soundtrack has been changed.

Nope, Coach still does not like short people. lol
Cue 27 point blowout
medley lambitin
I’ve never heard tht song before immediately knew it was randy Newman 😂
Curry is too big for lebron and ad😂😂😂😂 game 2
oof
Kerr spammed the Steph-Dray PnR in game 2. He uses that whenever he wants to win. The Kings lost game 7 because of that.
Time to make a new video about how curry is too big for ad and LeBron
This shit was funny.. until I saw game 2
AD took the night off.  Refs weren't giving him the foul calls
Short people got game 2 by 27
Game 2 is telling something how the series will go, 30pts difference at 3rd quarter is telling something, Warriors is too intelligence in the League, thats the difference. theyre so good along the way.
watch curry eliminate the self proclaim king
lets see what the topic will be game 2 just finish
FT and Poole is the reason Lakers won, not Lakers. 🤷
This video is the definition of something not aging well…
Lebron travels on every spin move and most of his euros. He hops on his right foot twice it isn’t a matter of number of steps. I wonder when people are gonna start talking about it
Why you hate the lakers ?
The ref wanted the lakers to win.
Coach, please please please do a Knicks analysis.
Klay clearly fouled schoeder, before the wiggins tie up,  right?
I thought they had only played 1 game but it seems the series is over by the way the propaganda speaks
I was almost going to applaud you but your Laker and Lebron bias is still under the surface. This was more of what did the Warriors do wrong to lose and not what a freaking awesome job the Lakers did defensively. Come on, you have to do better. I thought you were an X and O's guy? The Lakers defense was legendary.
Lakers 26 free throws to Warriors 6 is insane.
I think Lakers have this one in 5 pretty easily. I know you said you think Warriors will eventually win by playing the percentages of 3 > 2, but unless the  Warriors figure out a way to attack the paint and either get buckets or free throws, LA's gameplan just feels more sustainable. The Warriors were *terrified* of the paint all game, and for good reason. Hard to see how they adjust to fix it, since if they go ultra small and play Poole big minutes, they're gonna get murked since he sucks
Notice how AD sits in the center of the lane and hangs out for well-past the 3 seconds he should be there. Hope the refs tighten up that call.
When Curry gets his shots block it really gets into his head
Guess the refs will keep calling against Golden State till the end of the season - I mean they called against them all season long -perhaps it was naive to think they would finally make the right calls - especially after the Draymond Disaster I really thought so. That ref bullshit will cost them eventually - no way to win against 8 ...
Schroeder flopping and playing dirty was pissing me off so much
Im a laker fan and its only one game like kobe said the job ain't done yet.. if curry goes off and takes Antony davis out the paint lakers are done.. no  eazy series...
cool! I almost died too for a quick second ✅👊👊👊😍
Wow ! great sense of humor
Lebron and AD playing 40+ minutes a game could have a big impact in the long run
Coach, Divincenzo for Poole in crunch time?
I think he has a better feel for his role and can make big shots if he's open like at Villanova. + better defensively. What you guys think?
Lakers in 5
"Happiness is a butterfly, which when pursued, is always beyond your grasp, but which, if you will sit down quietly, may alight upon you." *Nathaniel Hawthorne
LeBron had a bad game if he gets going and the Warriors have no answer for AD this will be a short series .
the song got me 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
I could be wrong, but even though he's not big, I think Dennis Schroder's defensive effort and strength looked to bother Curry for quite a bit of this game, and I wonder if Curry's going to be gassed the longer it goes trying to fight him.
Why did they remove Lebron's 5th assist after the game?
All the B**chin' and moanin' over the last play is a joy to behold. I now remember why I don't watch this channel anymore.
That thumbnail lmaooo
Almost forgot how it felt when I played against very tall persons
54 points in paint for lakers
28 points in paint for warriors

warriors took 53 attempted 3's they gotta head to the hoop if they want more foul calls, that's the truth.. poole and klay are just chucking 3s might get a couple foul calls as jp did get 1 4point play but they need more players to play like looney
love to hear salty Warriors fan LOL
Good analysis but the conspiracy talk should be below you.
Dubs rim play was very unimaginative this time. At least Steph usually makes those insane under and from behind layups lobs and high off the bank shots. Its like they all panicked...
Except Looney, he is a beast, they might unleash him on AD like Zaza😎
When you come to @BBallBreakDown for the music... Still bumpin "give it up - KC" ... LAKERS vs CELTICS finals... BOOK IT
1:15. You missed when Curry was in the lane for 5 seconds just hanging out. 18-13 second mark on shot clock.  Refs must be blind.
The no calls for the Warriors played in the Lakers favor with their height on defense along with a few bad plays from the Warriors. Tonight I hope the Warriors adjust to what worked for them & play better defense
Didn't Kerr say he didn't want to drive into the paint against AD?
Vanderbilt was killing it on defense. Goode job LAkers
Coach, not sure if you noticed. Lakers coach in fact stepped inside, trying to affect Poole's game-tying 28-footer. That should be 1 shot T and the ball. The sideline ref was right there and somehow missed it.
I seen clowns crying about the free throw difference they were either big warriors fans or didnt watch the game
Too many illegal screens from the warriors 🤷‍♂️
One davis injury away from losing 4 in a row
The warriors tried to be what they weren’t which is a attack the basket team they were still on autopilot from last series where there’s no one protecting the rim on Sacramento
Bro you have to put the old music back. !!
pause
Need to go back to the old theme song. This isn’t it.
is it me or was this lakers team built for the playoffs.. they are the 2nd biggest team in the playoffs.. every team playing not named Denver is smaller than the lakers.. the knicks are the 3rd biggest team which they might make it to the finals.. maybe Denver Nuggets vs New York Knicks 2023 Nba Finals.. or if the heat upset the knicks then its going to be bosten in the finals again.. Los Angeles vs Bosten.. hmm now those are ratings, even Los Angeles vs New york will probly break nba ratings records.. we will see
I cant stand all these comments like "Take AD off the team and they get swept". Take ANY good teams best player and they lose. Take away Jokic, Giannis, Curry, Tatum/Brown, Jimmy Butler, Embid, etc.
Do you all remember when Coach Nick said the Rockets were going to beat the Lakers after 1 game in 2020? Yeah, I still do.
They can't deal with curry, look how tired the Lakers look at the end, 🤣😂 lil do they know they played the warriors game the whole time.
warriors fans crying
Coach Nick hates the lakers he’s still mad about being completely wrong. Remember when he said Harrison Barnes would be better than curry. This guys an idiot
Great game, both teams came ready to compete. 

I still think Lakers having 29 free throws to Golden State's 6 is pretty unfair.
So the foul when klay hugged and hit Dennis “shouldn’t matter”, yet they should be awarded a jump ball?…yea ok🤦🏾‍♂️🤣
Prisoners of the moment it’s only game. Over dickriding
lol that intro song.
GSW Assistant Coaches - Shouldn't we be looking at game film?

Coach Kerr - *eats a handful of popcorn* Nah, we'll just wait for Coach Nick to put up a video.
The warriors was afraid of the paint lol
I don't think that wiggins had possession long enough to call for a jump ball in that spot, even in slow-mo it didn't seem long enough.
Thompson just caught him from behind with both hands… clearly a foul no doubt about it.
There are no exceptions if it’s a close game in the playoffs. Rules are rules for a reason😪
Sounds like a Warriors fan.
The foul the two minute report refers to being missed is likely Klay’s left hand grabbing Dennis’ left arm. It’s subtle, and I agree it’s not often called.
i’m a warriors fan and this roster is simply weak. your 6th man has 1 good day out of 10 on offense, but 10 bad days out of 10 in defense. and the bench is riddled with kids and bums that still don’t know how to rotate in a golden state defensive system, that makes the 2nd unit unplayable unless you stagger the starter’s minutes. but of course, that means they gotta close to 40 minutes every game, which just isn’t sustainable. i just don’t like our bench at all.
I love how coach always lets his script lead into the song lmaooo love this channel
This was an on very poor 3 point shooting night by LA. Imagine them knocking down threes
the opening song is so foul lol
LeBron’s career outlasted the dominance of Warriors dynasty. 

Talk about taking the “long game”
This opening has to be one of your best! The music w/ the video was *chef kiss*.
Put draymond on anthony Davis! I've seen draymond completely shut him down with his defense in multiple games throughout his career! 

Wtf is Kerr thinking!
All those hits driving to the basket and they get no calls but warriors get called when it’s reversed
It's funny everyone says players don't get the same calls in the playoffs they normally would get during the regular season, and then there's the lakers
easy, destroy ad right knee or put kuminga to draw foul on AD and land on his right knee
this mtfk bringing his own whistle
I mean obviously AD is very long and athletic, but his timing is absolutely incredible too, lots of these blocks a foul if he's a split second too early or late.
Dennis was fouled by Klay Thompson. Last 2 minute report indicated that. No need to ball gargle
So LA did exactly what I said; Vando on Curry (why was there any debate on this...) and everybody else gets sent middle into the AD block party.

It's a very effective strategy against GS, they don't really have good enough slashers to punish this tech and while they had a good night from 3, they were horrific from 2.
Get
That
Weak
Shit
Outta
Here
Salty 😂
Lol this song is so funny 😅😅
I was yelling jumpball when I watched this live idk what the refs were thinking.
Biased
GSW team is too short. 😂
Are you a coach for a team or a trainer? You really explained it so well, great video you definetly put some good work on it.
the only hope Warriors have is to shoot 50% from the 3 point line.
Who do you think you are punk? Did you experience actually playing or coaching in the NBA yourself?
Who do you are? Are you an NBA Coach in the past?
I think the small ball era is slowly fizzling out
this whole series will be determined by AD's health and presence. Without him it'll be like 2 years ago when the Lakers lost the series to Denver
If what I’m supposed to be concerned about is Ad beating me, I feel pretty good as warriors. I think it’s fairly predictable they showed out in game 1. It was the fully rested, Lebron set the tone game l. I think it’s fairly predictable warriors wax them in game 2.
you can hear the sadness in Coaches voice that lebron is winning again.
10:10 Klay fouled Dennis bruh he wrapped his arms all around him
Iyak🤣🤣
The game was still close despite Lakers dominating down low. You cannot count out Warriors until you eliminate them. Steve Kerr will make adjustments. This series will prolong to 6 or 7 games. It's a battle of the styles of play. We will see what will happen! If you are the Lakers, you want to abuse them in the paint, and attack the basket constantly. If you are the Warriors, you want to shoot threes and draw the opposing big men to the perimeter.
No foul calls for the Warriors. 

29 to 6 free throws in a playoff game? 

Thats absurd.
😂 the intro
I think the foul commentary is silly, the GPII touch on Schroeder is nothing, the JP bump on AD is nothing etc. If you compare these slight touches with the average Curry-off-ball-possession it is simply a huge problem that the refs tilt their calls in this way. Curry even gets wacked on a three pointer. We all wish to be able to ignore the refs, but spotlighting it and while still doing a full burning-house-it's-fine meme is silly.

Lots of things Lakers did well and Warriors have to do better, but this is just hindsight commentary.
now they probably miss wiseman
Silly music, never use it again
Curry getting his pretty boy frontrunning ass whooped. No more easy layups like last series dawg. You gotta work for your shit now weak boy. Tired of seeing him get that weak shit and all the glory when they win and no blame when he loses. And yall wanna talk about bron but curry get shielded more than anybody. The way bron got his team, he dont gotta drop 30 to win but the warriors revolve their game around curry getting 30 every game just to give him shine not to necessarily give his team the best chance to win. When curry out, they dk how to play. When randle out, knicks still play hard. When embid out, 76ers still know how to play ball. When jimmy butler out, heat still know how to compete. When curry is out, the team looks like they never played without curry before like "oh sit what do i do now? Im not screen setting anymore and not used to getting any shots and having plays ran for me." Eff steph. I wanna see you show up when the pressure is on against an EXPERIENCED GREAT TEAM. He only confident against young inexperienced teams with big holes in their game aka kings aka celtics last finals turning the ball over eveey possession with tatum shrinking
Lakers in 4!
GSW in 5
Draymond already has plans on taking him down. Just you wait and see.
So Klay can just hug Schroder at the end and that is not a foul and actually a cover up by the refs??? what
Can someone also talk about the officials in this game. Warriors start cruising and suddenly all warriors players start getting foul after foul while lakers nothing. Also lakers players shutting down warriors offense by grabbing everyone. I cant imagine how frustrsting must be work your ass off all season long and getting that much handicap against a really good oponent. Same old nba, same old rigged sh*t
The lakers have the best defensive front court in the nba
This coach dude is so shameless in his bias, truly prevents hie channel from growing.
Hey I don't watch basketball on tv all that much anymore but can someone tell me if what is happening at 6:33 is something people just do now??? Like do we not go back behind the baseline anymore? Was that just a rule for kids and I never knew??????????
That 4th qtr showed how the whole series will play out.
Next week video will be Curry is too small and fast.
The hand in the cookie jar again...

Just gona say 1 thing. Warriors shot them 1st FT by the end of 2nd quarter if not start of 3rd... When Lakers already shot 12...

Not an excuse since warriors won 4 titles officiated so...

But yh... Even with that help your lakers gona loose... Sorry 🤷🏾‍♂️
Coach, you are right. Steph should have shot the ball instead of trying to get to the basket and getting block by AD. They should just shoot the lights out!
I said before this series started that the difference maker would most likely be AD. Kevon Looney performs amazingly for someone his height but the warriors don't have a true big and AD was in DPOTY mode in this game. You can't have no true rim protector going against a team as big as AD and Bron make the Lakers in the paint.
Davis is not Sabonis. 😅
you should play your main song you always put, that one is perfect for your videos
A line up of D Lo, AR, Vandy, Bron and AD is a gigantic line up.
AD presence terrorized warriors and they had a great shooting. This series will end early and easy
it does not matter who wins between lakers and warriors, it is denver who will go to nba finals
Coach Nick almost to 1MIL 🎉
Excellent song choice playing in the background 😂😂😂😂
The background song makes this video 10X more brilliant
Why these clips are something around 480p of resolution? So unpleasant to watch
Pump fakes should be used more in the paint. Everyone in the league big or small should use it more
Kuminga needs to play this series
Let’s not forget this is a warriors team with a weak bench vs a deep superteam with two superstars
Funny how warriors fans making the ft an excuse, they never realize that Warriors cannot attack the rim and decided to bom up threes, of they wont get free throws. On the other hand we know no one in warriors can defend AD alone.
Maybe just me but I found the music really distracting. Love the videos and appreciate the work that goes into them though 👍✌️
Darvin Ham and his assistant were also trying to block Jordan Poole and was clearly on the court in front of the ref and the ref just pretends to see nothing.
BRUH YOU JINXED US!!! Now I'm definitely placing my bets for Warriors W for Game 2. You saw it here first. These people giving the champs no chance are delusional. They are the previous champs for a reason! Don't underestimate them. This is what motivates them to championships. 😢
"pro trick" no more like if they give curry free throws when they r hitting 3's too, the games would be over by the 4th quarter .
come on Coach!! "Short Short Man" by Gillette (rearranged) was right there!!! can you hear me shaking my head?
cool but pause for that video title
LAKERS💛💛💛💛
That song is a violation 😂
this video sounds biased towards gs
yea im sure the warriors will make 2o something threes a game and shoot 40%. while the lakers just stay the same. fucking moronic take. its fine if you dont like bron but this video is just annoying tone wise cause you make it seem like lakers played they best ball.
As a Lakers fan, to be honest if this matchup had been a pure chess match between Darvin Ham and Steve Kerr (all on-court personnel being equal), then I'd have been totally afraid. Steve Kerr is on a different level from Ham.
lets Just enjoy this series
Let's see how consistent can Poole and Klay with their 3's in Game 2.
Lol Klay does not have clear possession there. He’s just wrapping his arms around Schroder. Not even on the ball
Had the refs calls the game like they do on the last 5 minutes of this match the result would be different. But i guess its still more on the warriors they got scared going to the basket knowing the refs wont call anything in their favor so they settle on the outside.
I don’t think coach like Lebron. Lakers won but he seemed to criticize the Lakers more than the Warriors.
I think we need a full episode analyzing the f’n referees and the corrupt NBA. 🤮🤮🤮🤮
This was a good breakdown until you insist that there should have been a jump ball in the last seconds of your video..
Game 2 is a live or die situation for the Warriors. No way in hell you’d beat a deep Lakers team led by AD and Bron after losing 2 home court games in a row. I know they’ve been down 0-2 before but the Lakers ain’t  Sacramento.

I expect them to make adjustments and win in game 2, or this series is over
Lebron just being one of the best pieces on a team now like every other great player has done for an entire career makes people think he’s not good anymore lol 😂
Pretty sure the Lakers realized the Warriors would get some 3s with Davis in the paint, but are gambling that the Warriors can't win 4 games by shooting basically only 3s
Thx coach
Horrible call at the end 2 seconds that’s got to be a jump ball
💯💛💜🥶
Warriors are fine they just can’t challenge them at the rim so much. Kuminga is the best option to put pressure on the rim and paint. Warriors took too many bad shots and just got too deep in the paint instead of giving it up you can’t try to challenge Davis at the rim pass the ball
AD never has back to back great games, he should be back to earth in game two.
AD with the Intimidator hall of fame
Lebron James must go to the bench at the beginning of the 4th Quarter and let Rui Hachimura play at the 4-spot with Anthony Davis. 
Rest on the bench so that Lebron will be fresh near the end of the 4th Quarter.
Curry 6ft 2 . Not short lol
bballbreakdown such warriors bias as usual
Don't want no SHORT PEOPLE........😀😁😂
You might want to lower the music a Bit.
Bball breakdown hates the nuggets
Got doninated by AD and curry says he can beat prime shaq and kobe
Warriors need to clean up on fouling and they will win series.
curry gets hit on the elbow many times at the 3 point line.
AD needs to make 30 , 20 every game. If not they gonna lose. AD needs to take care of his conditioning ..Warriors will ganna wear him down
Lakers in 5 or 6 IDGAF how many 3s the Warriors make
Great breakdown until 10:15 when you claim wiggins has firm control when the next angle shows shroeder bouncing between one hand of klay and wigging trying to lift and replace his left arm. Fact is that neither player except dennis had full control and klays foul should have sent dennis to the line so warriors actually benefited from the non call. Solid closeout by lakers and smart of dennis not to try and pass out since he was rightly expecting free throws off klays sloppiness
The music is corny, atleast put some current tunes
Great content and meanwhile in the bay area the lakers and lebron about to end the warriors 😒
Steph not goin out like that
that intro song LOL
Moving screens galore
and its not even the full potential of this lakers team..
Hello
You agree when it’s against the Lakers😂 typical coach
nah its Lakers in 4 hahahaha
Draymond being a generational illegal screen setter and whining about one to get a tech is hilarious
That Lakers starting lineup (AD, Bron, Vanderbilt, DLo & AR) is just as complete as it can be when it comes to offense and defense. This is similar to Bron's team in Miami, only bigger. In short, they're winning this!
Great details in this breakdown Coach Nick 🔍
Lakers are good enough to beat the warriors any day of the week without the help of referees unfortunately the NBA doesn't see it that way.
Another great assessment Coach, I’d like to see Lonnie Walker play some in this series for more offense firepower especially if they’re not going to play Malik Beasley it seems like or at least not yet! Regardless I think we basketball fans are in for a great series 👌🏼🙏🏼
Great theme song btw
haven't watched the replay yet but the difference between their free throws is disgustingly fishy
typical coach nick lakers post. Starts with showing what they did right then proceeds to present sus stuff lowkey implying the opponent lost cos of the refs lmao. always trying to devalue whatever the Lebron-led team did. For a fundamentalist/ purist, he almost always (ALWAYS) picks the team against Bron. Warriors shot 106 field goal attempts and 53 of those were threes. more than half were contested and you trying to say that's an efficient offense? They look lost and just spamming high pick N rolls from Curry when they know Vanderbilt can solo coverage him and he has to meet AD at the rim. Kerr did not adjust and just prayed Poole and Klay's shots would fall. They chose to shoot outside so they draw fouls less and fouls more on the other side, hence the disparity in free throws. It isn't that deep. Im not 100% sure the Lakers would win this one, I just found it laughable every time coach nitpicks a Lebron-lead team and then proceeds to change his views when the opp is losing. lmao
The Lakers got so much free throws because they attack the rim hence getting the Warriors in Foul trouble. The Warriors are ranked 29th in free throws all season because all they do is shoot 3s. The Lakers are 1st in free throws all season because they play inside the paint. Also, the Warriors shot more 3s than the Lakers and still LOST! They made 21 3s this game and still LOST! Steph, Klay, and Pool had made 6 3s each, and still lost. What happened when the Lakers start making their 3s?? - it's game over when that happens
This dude loves GS
The Warriors can't do much more than this to beat the Lakers. Meanwhile, one would expect the Lakers can put a couple more 3-pt in the basket than they did on game 1. And, unlike the Kings, the Lakers can play defense.
PS: why should the refs have called a jump ball if Klay fouled Dennis first??
I totally dis agree with u bballbreakdown, as long the warriors 3 pt shots gets in, they have chances.. but if not? Sorry the lakers will demolish them.
dont matter.. either team gets bounced in the WCF anyway
WIth that timeout at the end, you can clearly see shroeder SCREAMING timeout the second he gets his hands at the ball. That's why he looks at the ref so frustrated right after cuz he was hollerin for the timeout!
Lmao the look on pooles face when d lo punked him over and over again
Coach Nick was going through it watching this.... AHAHHAHAHA... poor guy
Intro music sounds like writer got dumped by gf over short man
The thing is curry out shot any guy on lakers team. Lakers can’t shoot. Next game lakers will lose
A running team vs throwing team fr running eventually slow the game down lakers free throws etc shooting prayers is literally warriors they lived and died and ppl complain they ain’t have as many fouls I rarely see shooting fouls from three unless it’s for the warriors on them bs screens then throwing it up to god
Coach Nick with another football reference at 7:11?? I thought you hated football??
AD presence effect gsw shooting even if he didnt contest💯
It leaves me scratching my head why the kings didn't abuse the warriors in the paint all last series.
My new favorite YouTube channel
IT'S HARD TO BEAT ANY TEAM WHEN THEY SHOOT 29 FREETHROWS TO 6 COME ON TELL THA TRUTH
The refs handed this one to the Lakers. doing overtime
Everybody loves to talk when they up
Lakers fan bias thru the roof with this title... Despicable smh
That intro song playing like a movie w/ a happy ending
loving bball breakdown more and more everyday
Pretty good analysis but too bad it just had such a biased feel to it

Edit: finished the video and the bias is massive
Wiggins was never in control of the ball. His other hand was on Dennis' arm.
3:17 “The warriors not used to getting their shot blocked in transition” 
R u sure about that👀
No contest,  big man basketball against the little men.  Even shooting miracles of 3 going in for the Warriors will not save their season. Downright conclusions, Lakers are more dominating and better than the Warriors.  Laker sweep Warriors easy. No need for any further debate or discussion.  Laker in 4.
GSW is gonna make AD get mega fatigued by the third game. Forcing the dubs to shoot 3s is an exceptionally bad idea.
salty tears from Coach
I don't think Thompson fouled Schroder but the problem that presents is if the league thinks that was foul it would've sent Schroder to the line with enough time for the warriors to get the ball back which is why I thought the refs didn't call it because they wanted to make sure as much time as possible came off the clock before giving the warriors another change. 

That was calculated and the idea the league only has a last two minute report is ludicrous. Why don't they do a report for the entirety  of the game. Only the last two minutes happens? If they did the entire game it would expose how bad officiating is.
I love your tears coach NIck, stay salty
what an incredible breakdown of the game..
Lakers fans y'all going to be real disappointed 😤
AD changes everything
this guy needs to go back to the old music for the videos. this other music just isnt it man
funny how you point out all the missed calls in favor of the lakers but you are not able to point out the number of illegal screens that they let the warriors do. in each of the offensive plays of the warriors that you showed there is an illegal screen
The choice of background songs is triggering me, Coach Nick! All 5'6" of me! 😅
@8:22 I slowed it down and paused it. Vanderbilt committed his sixth foul here and should've fouled out of the game. However Lebron and AD was able to negotiate that foul away from him without reviewing any footage. They just took their word for it. Vanderbilt hits curry on the shoulder than drags down his jersey before AD hits Currys hands. This is the type of stuff I'm talking about that ya'll just ignore like it doesn't affect the outcome of games.
looks like on warriors side 😅😂🤔
Coach, just say you hate the Lakers and don’t want them to win, L take just respect what the Lakers are doing especially their insane defense
Can't wait to see what adjustment both teams make, its gonna be a fun series to watch
🤨
Wiggins didnt have control
Why wasn't it called a foul when AD knocked Draymond down? Shroder fell with Poole guarding him and was awarded a foul. Are you just going to lie and act like one team was undisciplined and the other team played perfect defense or are you going to tell the truth about the atrocious officiating. I guess honest people no longer exist.
meh i don't see wiggings having control on that ball. he has his hands there but when Dennis put it down, wiggins had no grip on it
Does Coach Nick shakes his head when watching Jordan Poole?
This channel isn’t a basketball break down, it’s a big market break down. Just doing videos about all the big market teams.
short people! is a trackkkkkkk coach 😂
Maaaaan I learn a lot from this channel 👍👍👍
Perfect song 😂😂😂😂
Right after the Lebron travel curry travelled
Golden State played great and lost because of FT discrepancies not because of Lebron and AD. Looney shot 11 shots and went to the Line. Schroder shot less in the paint and went to the line more than the entire warriors team.
Wiggens was holding the arms of Schroeder and didn't really have the ball.
Wait hold on, didn't watch the game but at 1:44 Lakers shot 17 FT to GSW... 0?
LFG!
Your not going to beat the Warriors by making 3s so the Lakers are playing to their advantages.
We’re finally witnessing the passing of the torch 🥲
What is this song lmao
I'll tell you something man, Warriors made a franchise record 3's in a half and were still down, they tied for 3rd for team 3's in a playoff game, they still 40% from 3, we have the paint on lock,
LeBron played like Dillon Brooks, and was even missing layups, we shot 24% from three and we STILL won😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Lakers in 5
the foul is klay holding onto dennis' arm while he was going after the loose ball. either way it shouldve been lakers ball.
Love these geeky sound tracks
You sounds like a your one of the warriors fan like those big media stream.. instead of giving lakers credit, they’re focus on why Jordan Poole took that shot 🤷🏽
I'll always remember BBALLBREAKDOWN's "LeBron is old as fuck" comment way back. 🤣🤣🤣
Tom Thib always have the tendency of playing their starplayer heavy min and wearying them out,samething happen to Drose,hopefully AD can stay healthy throughout the series
1:26 Wiggins should’ve stayed in that corner to keep Bron from collapsing. When he popped out, he put himself in a spot where 1 defender could guard 2 Warriors. They’ll fix those small things with spacing, start running that high screen again to pull AD out the paint
play defense, abuse ad, make warriors uncomfortable while they chuck 3s, get good looks inside the paint, and don't overly rely on 3s, yeah should be easy win for the lakers.
shouldve added the play where curry went under the basket, left his feet to pass out and vanderbilt tipped the pass for a steal. Another great example in that game of how length really bothered the champs in game 1
Nick is obviously a Warrior fan 😅
One of the most bias basketball vlogs I’ve seen. The refs should have called a foul the moment klay grabed schroder’s arm plus Wiggins was behind shroder grabing the ball and not touching the ball with both hands.
another biased video from a warriors fan, i see
The song in the beginning 😂😂
JP IS AS SHARP AS SC however SC is the main thing..one time SC THREW his mouthpiece when JP shoot the ball instead of passing the ball to him..good the ball went in and the win of curz ..and jokingly JP threw his mouth piece too infront of SC..but it was not blown up in the Media..otherwise the young JP will be BBQD again
What is that goofy ass music
🟪🟨LETS GO LAKERS🫶🏽🟨🟪🟨LETS GET ANOTHER “W”🟪🟨
Coach ain’t gunna like when the lakers win this in 5
Lmao this man is a Warriors fan, but it doesn’t matter 😂 just make sure to make a video analyzing the entire series when it’s over 😉
Lebron showing his age in this game, he look exhausted in the 4th and doing brick shots. Well they still won because of AD and the help of teammates.
the no jump ball in the end for shroeder and wiggins at the end makes up for all the pushing looney does and all the illegal screens the warriors pull ALL THE FUCKING TIME!
WHAT AN INTRO
Warriors played so badly but their shooting was okay. They went too much off ball with curry, and when kerr finally decided to put curry on ball— they went on 14-0 run. Too late though, common Warriors L. Always playing catch up and playing with fire
Talk talk talk😂😂😂
I always love when lebron proves this coach wrong.😂😂
Miss the old music. Lol
Draymond tiny in the thumbnail lol 🫳🏾
No jumpball it should be a foul. Your warriors would not win coach.
if lebron stops shooting 3s they can easily get 8 more points from him
Just imagine if they played the kings lol
not about the game.. I am glad that bballbreakdown does not accept gambling/betting sites for sponsors, I have seen basketball channels on YT and most of them are sponsored by betting sites, thank you bballbreakdown for not supporting those sites
I’m so glad to get a break from listening to, “Fighting from Freedom” 😮‍💨
Get that weak stuff out of here!
Not going to lie, it does feel like this video is really only focusing on the Warriors mistakes. Rather than praising the incredible defence the Lakers played, and everything else they did right. Feels a bit biased
We r now called the Los Angeles Swatters!!! We swatting shit!!💪💪💪
Lol dis breakdown got a lil suspect towards da end. Clearly a warriors fan. I think da jump ball/ foul/timeout culd have gone either way, but to basically say da warriors got robbed of a jump ball is a quite biased. Lol u can’t put 1 arm on da ball n da other around da guys waste to keep them where u want them until your teammate eventually gets both hands on da ball n say it’s definitively not a foul n think u can keep your credibility as an unbiased analyst. No matter how generic n auto tune-ish u make your narrator voice
Ty
What separates the Warriors from the Harden Rockets is that they aren't Moreyballing the 3 point shot.  The Dubs shoot a lot of threes, but they cut into the paint a lot too.  Their 3 point shooting gives them the spacing to drive.

The Lakers didn't stop the Warriors from getting buckets from beyond the arc, but they took away those inside looks.  If the Lakers force Steph and the rest to essentially live or die by the 3, they'll die three more times before they live four times in this series.
That intro was amazing Lmao
That is one hateful-ass 70s-80s song. Damn!
Lakers win the next game = win the series. For sure
I doubt klay and poole will shoot that well anymore, it’s insane to lose shooting this well from 3 point line.
I mean no shit, Curry still gonna get his regardless
Nah I could feel the tears through da screen bra 😂
Vando humble but poisonous
Lol the song is funny and fitting and I'm warriors fan
Great content as always coach.. I just want one shout out vid for the Knicks this season, I think they’ve earned some attention this year.. keep it up tho coach
Lol this whole video is so CLEARLY biased towards the Warriors, it’s kinda ridiculous. The lakers have been the better team for months now, but the video makes it seem like “oh the warriors gave this one away to the inferior team”. Yea yea … keep that same energy
a healthy and willing AD is really a problem for GSW. not so much with bron.
No Dennis called timeout nick you gotta stop that bs ! Watch the replays over shroeder called Timeout
Dillon brooks reminds me of this video I saw of a guy poking a moose and then it turns and runs him over
What missed jump ball? Wiggins wasn't able to get a clear hold of the ball. Come on now, coach.
Coach was crying while making this video 😆
If they’re gonna keep playing drop coverage on those DHOs, Poole/Curry/Klay will all shoot 40% from three this series. But they need to get to the line. Wiggins and Kuminga need to be slashers this series. If they send 2 at Steph, someone needs to be able to attack on the catch and put some sort of pressure on the rim. Defensively they should play some zone and get them to hit perimeter shots, but they should also throw some double teams at AD when they play man. Force him to the high post, don’t let him get comfortable in the mid range. 

I think Lakers size advantage will ultimately win out. Could very well see AD average 30 and 12 this series simply because no one on GSW can guard him unlike JJJ and Tillman last series
When nick roots for a team he’ll point out what the refs miss but won’t say anything about his team 😂
Watched the last quarter at work. Lmao. But yea, Tom thib d rose team vs Jimmys team. Then AD, what a treat. Playoffs peaking rn, LETS GOOOO
I know Coach is butthurt about this one 😂 he's always salty about the Lakers and especially LeBron hahaha
Too big For AD and Lebron.
Need A passenger for GSW Busses 
  Where KD At ?
Golden state has to deny Ad the ball and out hustle the Lakers on every play
The intro song is gold
Lakers really only have two people from that championship team.
Lol they won by 5
funny thing is the warriors made 21 3pts and still a lose
😂😂😂😂😂😂 not this song 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Was happily waiting on this one! Thank the universe for you, Coach!!
The disparity in calls is what cost the game. It's true that the Dubs doesn't attack the rim much and settle for jumpshots, but when they (Dubs) try to drive in the lane and it should've been called for a defensive foul, the refs wouldn't call on it. SMH!
Ur reaching lakers won lol
6 FREE THROWS. 🤔
Why do I always watch these and Nick is giving constant criticism and back handed compliments to LeBron led teams? Can you not be biased? Break it down properly?
Its really nice to see old school big man down low basketball at play. Not this 3pt shootouts we been seeing this last few yrs.
Steve Kerr was looking at Draymond and the ref like "Im not going to say anything, if Draymond gets a tech that'll just be a another reason to get rid of him this off-season" 🤣🤣🤣
Not a good sign for the Warriors. Their shooting can get hot, cold, or merely warm, but the Lakers size, length, and inside presence will not fluctuate and be a constant issue this series.
Curry have to start agressive more , he has to call pick in roll and make Davis more tired.Also Wiggins has to take advantage against Dlo. Klay started aggressive but not enough , I feel like Klay not like old Klay . I mean ı remember when he got free jumpshot, he was the money, it looks like not anymore.  Also Gsw have to use more Midrange,  I mean not only run for three and go little bit inside and make easier shot. 

Lakers was great on defense and they know what their best. Gsw have to push them more and need to find solution on Davis.Lebron not look like  2016 lebron anymore and Lakers not great shooter team  especially on 3 points.  This series will be depend on Gsw will stop AD or not.
Golden State winning this series
warriors cant guard AD for sure.
i wont be surprised if warriors aee swept in this series tbh
Good analysis coach
warriors will adjust. they always do.
GS in 6
You can tell this guy doesn’t like the lakers very much
It's kind of absurd how much illegal contact Draymond and Looney get away with in the forms of holding and shoving. Don't get me started on the number of moving screens the warriors get away with..
with AD playing at that level & 100% healthy LA will be a very tough team regardless of who they play.
game ball goes to jarred vanderbilt. his defense on curry was criminally underrated
The backwards backhand block by AD was insane
Sounds like a gangbang lol
This channel needs to change it's name to WARRIORS BREAKDOWN. Stop trying to be objective coz the bias is really showing.
8:18 what are you talkin' 'bout, coach...???  you get two steps to gather a ball now.
The warriors saw ghosts whenever they were in the paint. Good job by AD getting in their heads early
A younger LeBron would threepeat with this team.
To be honest, of all teams remaining, Lakers has the roster most like a championship team, I don't want to say they are because 1, they are not experience as a whole, 2, Darvin Hamm has no big fight experience, 3, AD can get hurt any minutes. But boy do they pose problems, "the best lineup in NBA" of the warrios can't deal with Lebron AD and another big inside, when outside Klay Wig and GP2 can't stop Lebron Reaves and Shroder, and you have to mind Russell shot here and there, it's a headache, when I saw Steve Kerr put Draymond on Russell, I laughed then sighed, because whatelse can he try? They don't have enough players good enough for this fight, in the end they had to hope that Steph gives world class one man army performance, again.
Maybeeeee if the warriors stop trying to get to the bucket with AD & Lebron there 😂 idk why they didn’t stick to 3s. Lakers are not even close to warriors in that area
this years Finals,reprise of 2020's....Heat vs Lakers...i already watched via satelitte programme.
Pause
Nuggets and suns breakdown if interested
0:49 Klay inside foot drag
Chef curry cook in the 3 point line but AD eat inside the paint.
for some strange reason idiots like poole and trae seem to think any shot anywhere on the court is good for them. the sheer ego is off the charts, esp. when poole had plenty of time to step up and hit a normal 3 in rhythm, OR hit klay under the rim by himself. but poole is convinced he's the hero of this narrative i guess.
I’ve never seen a 7th seed as championship contenders like this lakers team. Also that 14-0 run ONLY happened due to Jared Vanderbilt who held curry to 2-10 shooting when guarding him but when he was subbed right back in the warriors couldn’t score. Klay did foul Dennis at the end but it wasn’t called, this will be a very interesting series and it’ll be even more interesting if the lakers win and the excuses people will continue using.
I miss the original background music
The Lakers size was a factor...So was the 29 trips they were awarded to the free-throw line to the Warriors 6. A difference of 20 points. And the game still went down to the wire...I don't think the powers that be want the Dubs to win this series. Memories of 2016 resurface.
agree. WE ALL KNOW THAT IS THE CASE FROM trade deadline haha.
Song choices always on point 👌
Gg, Warriors in 7. Not a lot if rest between games its all uphill for the Lakers from here.
I don't remember toy story having tall people propaganda
The funny thing is that Lebron didn't need to carry the team offensively as mush compared to his past teams. Anthony Davis and every other player understood their role and stock to it.
Mid range adjustments coming
lakers in 5
Interesting choice of song 😂
First

Davis kinda fell off after the first half tho
Incredible game. I got LA in 6. Love your vids man. Keep it up.
first acknowledge me
yo!
